Software Defect Prediction is one of the most active research areas in software engineering. Finding and fixing defects costs companies around the world huge amounts of money and therefore any automated help in reliably predicting where faults are, and focusing the efforts of testers, has a significant impact on the cost of production and maintenance of software. Various regression techniques and recently also machine learning algorithms had been utilized to provide better insight into software repositories and help developers as well as testers to invest their time at work more effectively.
