\textbf{Abstract:} Many data mining methods have already been introduced into defect predictions. In our work, we tested and compared the results obtained from Naive Bayes and J48 decision tree based defect prediction model. For prediction itself, metrics like .... were used. We also argue about the topic of general defect prediction model and usage of the very same model within several environments.
